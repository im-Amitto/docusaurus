# From zero to deploy
Welcome to Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails. The purpose of this book is to teach you how to develop custom web applications, and our tool of choice is the popular Ruby on Rails web framework.

>The Ruby on Rails Tutorial is part of the Learn Enough to Be Dangerous family of tutorials, which develop the theme of technical sophistication: the combination of hard and soft skills that make it seem like you can magically solve any technical problem (as illustrated in “Tech Support Cheat Sheet” from xkcd)
